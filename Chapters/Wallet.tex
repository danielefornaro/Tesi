A Bitcoin wallet is a structure used to store keys. \\ \\
There are different type of wallet:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Nondeterministic (\textit{random}) Wallet
	\item Deterministic Wallet
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
	Bitcoin wallets contains keys, not coins. Coins are in the Blockchain.
\end{remark}

\section{Nondeterministic (\textit{random}) Wallet}
A nondeterministic wallet is the simplest type of wallet. Each Key is randomly and independently generated.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Consider a \textit{Discrete Uniform Random Variable}
	\begin{equation*}
		X\sim \mathcal{U}(S)
	\end{equation*}
	Where $S$ is the finite set of natural number in the range from $1$ to $order$.
	\item Take some realizations $k_1,k_2...k_n$ of $X$ using enough entropy to make these numbesr (\textit{private keys}) impossible to guess.
	\begin{equation*}
		k_1=X(\omega_1) \quad  k_2=X(\omega_2) \quad ... \quad k_n=X(\omega_n)
	\end{equation*}
	\item Go back to point (i) every time new \textit{private keys} are needed.
\end{enumerate}
With this procedure it is impossible to compute the \textit{public key} without having already the \textit{private key}.

\subsubsection{Pros and Cons}
Let's focus on the good and bad aspects of this wallet.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Easy to implement
	\end{itemize} &
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Difficult to find \underline{real} new entropy for every new \textit{private key}.
		\item Every time new \textit{private keys} are needed, you need to make new back up.
		\item Difficult to store or back up in a \textit{non digital way}. Awkward to write it down all yours keys on a paper.
	\end{itemize}\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The use of \textit{random wallet} is strongly discouraged for anything other than simple test. There are no good reason to use it.

\section{Deterministic Wallets}
A deterministic wallet is a more sophisticated one, in which every key is generated from a common "\textit{seed}". This means that knowing the \textit{seed} means also to know all the keys in the wallet.\\ \\
There are different types of deterministic wallets, in this text we will analyze three main types:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deterministic Wallet \textit{type 1}
	\item Deterministic Wallet \textit{type 2}
	\item Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet
\end{itemize}
These wallet are in increasing order of complexity.

\subsection{Deterministic Wallet \textit{type-1}}
The Deterministic Wallet \textit{type-1} is one of the simplest Wallet among the deterministic ones. Each key is generated adding a number in a sequential order to the \textit{seed} and then computing an \textit{hash} function such as the \textbf{SHA256} function.
\\ \\
Let's see how to generate the $n^{th}$ private key:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Generate a \textit{seed} (only once), a random number from a \textit{Discrete Uniform Random Variable}
	\begin{equation*}
	seed=X(\omega) \qquad X\sim \mathcal{U}(S)
	\end{equation*}
	Where $S$ is the finite set of natural number in the range from $1$ to $order$.
	\item Consider the numbers $seed$ and $n$ as strings and concatenate $n$ to $seed$, obtaining a $value$
	\begin{equation*}
	value=seed|n
	\end{equation*}
	\item Compute the SHA256 function to $value$ and obtain the $n^{th}$ \textit{private key}.
	\item Go back to point (ii) every time new \textit{private keys} are needed with $n=n+1$. 
\end{enumerate}
With this procedure it is impossible to compute the \textit{public key} without having already computed the \textit{private key}.

\subsubsection{Pros and Cons}
Let's focus on the good and bad aspects of this wallet.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ |p{6cm}|p{6cm}|  }
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{\textit{Deterministic Wallet type-1}}} \\
		\hline \hline 
		\\
		\centerline{\textbf{Pros}}&\centerline{\textbf{Cons}}\\
		\hline
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In order to make a back up of the entire wallet it is needed to store the \textit{seed} only. All \textit{private keys} can be derived from it.
			\item A single back up is needed.
			\item The \textit{seed} can be stored easily also in a \textit{non digital way}, in a paper for example.
		\end{itemize} &
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Every time new \textit{public keys} are needed, you need to use the \textit{seed}, to compute new \textit{private keys} and then derive the \textit{public} ones. This could compromise the entire wallet, if the \textit{seed} is used in a non safe environment.
			\item There is only a \textit{key} sequence. No way to distinguish the "purpose" of each \textit{private key}.
		\end{itemize}\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The use of this type of wallet is not recommended for everyday use, but it could be used to store Bitcoin in a safe place: \textit{cold wallet}. 

\subsection{Deterministic Wallet \textit{type-2}}
The Deterministic Wallet \textit{type-2} is more sophisticated. Each \textit{private key} is generated in such a way that it is possible to compute the respective \textit{public key} without knowing the \textit{private}.
\\ \\
First let's introduce the necessary ingredients:
\begin{itemize}[label=$\diamond$]
	\item \textbf{Master private key} ($mp$): a random number, generated from a \textit{Discrete Uniform Random Variable}
	\begin{equation*}
	mp=X(\omega) \qquad X\sim \mathcal{U}(S)
	\end{equation*}
	Where $S$ is the finite set of natural number in the range from $1$ to $order$. \\ The master private key must be take \underline{secret}.
	\item \textbf{Master public key} ($MP$): a point on the EC, obtained from the $mp$:
	\begin{equation*}
	MP=mp\cdot G
	\end{equation*}
	Where $G$ is the \textit{generator}.\\ This point can be consider \underline{non-secret}.
	\item \textbf{Public random number} ($r$): a random number, generated from a \textit{Discrete Uniform Random Variable}
	\begin{equation*}
	r=X(\omega) \qquad X\sim \mathcal{U}(S)
	\end{equation*}
	This number can be consider \underline{non-secret}.
\end{itemize}
Let's see how to generate the $n^{th}$ private key: $p_n$

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Compute the SHA256 function to the concatenation of $r$ with $n$, considered as string:
	\begin{equation*}
	h_{n|r}=SHA256 (n|r)
	\end{equation*}
	$h_{n|r}$ can be consider \underline{non-secret}, from the moment that it is derived from non secret information.
	\item Compute the $n^{th}$ \textit{private key} adding $mp$ to $h_{n|r}$:
	\begin{equation*}
	p_n=mp+h_{n|r} \qquad \mod (order)
	\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
In order to obtain the corresponding \textit{public key} $P_n$, it is possible to compute the standard multiplication:
\begin{equation*}
P_n=p_n \cdot G
\end{equation*}
It is also possible to compute $P_n$ without knowing $p_n$, using only non-secret information: $h_{n|r}$ and $MP$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Compute $V$:
	\begin{equation*}
	V=h_{n|r} \cdot G
	\end{equation*}
	$V$ can be see as the \textit{public key} of $h_{n|r}$ and can be consider \underline{non-secret}.
	\item Add $MP$ to $V$:
	\begin{equation*}
	P_n=MP+V
	\end{equation*}
	Where the sum in this contest is the one defined between two point in the EC.
\end{enumerate}
It is easy to prove that $P_n$ can be computed in these two way:
\begin{equation*} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
P_n & = p_n \cdot G \\
& = (mp+h_{n|r}) \cdot G \\
& = (mp \cdot G) + (h_{n|r}\cdot G) \\
& = MP + V
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Pros and Cons}
Let's focus on the good and bad aspects of this wallet.

		\centerline{\textbf{Pros}}&\centerline{\textbf{Cons}}\\
		\hline
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In order to make a back up of the entire wallet it is needed to store the \textit{master private key} and the random number $r$. All \textit{private keys} can be derived from them.
			\item A single back up is needed.
			\item The \textit{master private key} can be stored easily also in a \textit{non digital way}, in a paper for example.
			\item It is possible to derive a new \textit{public key} using only non-secret information, with the procedure above.
		\end{itemize} &
		\begin{itemize}
			\item There is only a \textit{key} sequence. No way to distinguish the "purpose" of each \textit{private key}.
		\end{itemize}\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The \textit{type-2 deterministic wallet} it is an improvement of the \textit{type-1} because it has the same benefits (except for the need to back up two number instead of only one), but with a great advantage: it is possible to generate new addresses also in a non safe environment, having only $r$ and $MP$. \\
A thief can only steal your privacy, because if $MP$ and $r$ are stolen, he is not able to make any Bitcoin transactions from your wallet, but he can see all the previous transactions and the total amount of Bitcoin stored in the wallet.
